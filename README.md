# nodeAPI

Basic Node API CRUD focused on learning how node really works under the hood. For that the project was made using Vanilla node without using any kind of frameworks for backend such as express.

**How to run :** 

```
cd src

node index.js
```

To test the routes working you can also try using a API Client plataform such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
